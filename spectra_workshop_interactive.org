* =Spectra=

** Import data from an /mzML/ file

- Load mzML data.
- =Spectra=: a list of MS spectra.
- /spectra variables/: values characterizing an MS spectrum
  - m/z and intensity values
  - MS level
  - retention time
  - precursor m/z
  - ...
- How to access spectra variables:
- Add new spectra variables:
- Drop/delete spectra variables

** The concept of the =MsBackend=

- =MsBackend=: stores and provides the spectrum data.
- =MsBackendMzR=: what data is actually stored?
- Change backend to =MsBackendDataFrame=.
- All data is in memory.
- Advantage of this?
  - Can have backends for each data type or resource.

** =MsBackendHmdb=: import data from HMDB

- Human metabolome database: MS2 spectra available as individual xml file.
- =MsBackendHmdbXml=: reads data from xml.
- Load the HMDB data.
- Cheating: load pre-read object.

** Match experimental spectrum against HMDB

- Cheating: subset HMDB...


** The future

- Slowly replace =MSnbase= with the new packages.
- Slowly integrate =Spectra=, =Chromatograms= into =xcms=.
- New packages should open up possibilities for MS data analysis - specifically
  aid annotation/identification.

** Opportunities

- We're open for contributions!

*** Implement own backends

- [ ] Backend to read/write /mgf/ files (Michael Witting).
- [ ] Backend to read/write MassBank files (Michael Witting, Emma Schymanski?).

*** Plotting functionality

- [ ] plotting functions for =Spectra= objects (base R graphics).
- [ ] ggplot-based plotting should ideally go into a separate package.

*** Integrate new packages in your own workflow/software

I'd suggest you switch sooner than later.
