# RforMassSpectrometry/Spectra workshop

*Presenter*: Johannes Rainer, Institute for Biomedicine, Eurac Research,
Bolzano, Italy.

This workshop is part of the [metaRbolomics hackathon
plus](https://rfmf-mpf-2020.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/32) workshop of
the [European RFMF Metabomeeting 2020](https://rfmf-mpf-2020.sciencesconf.org/)
in Toulouse. This workshop consists of a *static* part (presentation) and an
interactive walk-through the functionality of the
[Spectra](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/Spectra) R package.

The workshop provides background information on the new mass spectrometry
infrastructure and shows its usage on the example of matching an experimental
MS2 spectrum against a MS2 library.

## Main topics

- What is [RforMassSpectrometry](https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/)?
- What is available as of now? (`MsCoreUtils`, `Spectra`)
- Flexible infrastructure: use different backends to load, represent, store
  data.
- Use case: match measured MS2 spectrum against database.
- Missing pieces:
  - plotting functionality
  - backends to import/work with MGF data, MassBank, ...
  - other things we haven't thought of?
- How can **you** contribute?
